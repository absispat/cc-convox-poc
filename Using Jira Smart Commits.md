# Using Smart Commits

Smart Commits allow repository committers to perform actions such as transitioning Jira Software issues or creating Crucible code reviews by embedding specific commands into their commit messages.
You can:

  - comment on issues
  - record time tracking information against issues
  - transition issues to any status defined in the Jira Software project's workflow.

# Smart Commit Commands

The basic command line syntax for a Smart Commit message is:

```sh
<ignored text> <ISSUE_KEY> <ignored text> #<COMMAND> <optional COMMAND_ARGUMENTS>
```
Any text between the issue key and the Smart Commit command is ignored.
There are three Smart Commit commands you can use in your commit messages:

  - Comment
  - Time
  - Transition

# Comment

**Description**
Adds a comment to a JIRA Software issue.

**Syntax**
```sh
<ignored text> ISSUE_KEY <ignored text> #comment <comment_string>
```
**Example**
```sh
JRA-34 #comment corrected indent issue
```
**Notes**
The committer's email address must match the email address of a JIRA Software user with permission to comment on issues in that particular project.

If it does not match please go to the below mentioned link and configure the email address which matches with your Jira email as the commits would take place with the same mail id.

[GitHub Mail Config](https://github.com/settings/emails)

If the commits are performed from CLI then the git config settings should have the same mail id, if not you can follow below steps:

**To set your global username/email configuration:**
Open the command line.

Set your username:
```sh
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
```
Set your email address:
```sh
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```

**To set repository-specific username/email configuration:**
From the command line, change into the repository directory.

Set your username:
```sh
git config user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
```
Set your email address:
```sh
git config user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```
Verify your configuration by displaying your configuration file:
```sh
cat .git/config
```
you can also verify if the mail has been configured by using below command
```sh
git config --list
```

# Time

**Description**
Records time tracking information against an issue.

**Syntax**
```sh
<ignored text> ISSUE_KEY <ignored text> #time <value>w <value>d <value>h <value>m <comment_string>
```

**Example**
```sh
JRA-34 #time 1w 2d 4h 30m Total work logged
```
**Notes**

This example records 1 week, 2 days, 4 hours and 30 minutes against the issue, and adds the comment 'Total work logged' in the Work Log tab of the issue.

    - Each value for w, d, h and m can be a decimal number.
    - The committer's email address must match the email address of a single JIRA  Software user with permission to log work on an issue.
    - Your system administrator must have enabled time tracking on your JIRA Software instance.
 
# Workflow transitions
**Description**

Transitions a JIRA Software issue to a particular workflow state.

**Syntax**
```sh
<ignored text> ISSUE_KEY <ignored text> #<transition_name> <comment_string>
```
**Example**
```sh
JRA-090 #close Fixed this today
```
**Notes**

This example executes the close issue workflow transition for the issue and adds the comment 'Fixed this today' to the issue. Note that the comment is added automatically without needing to use the #comment command.

If a workflow has two valid transitions, such as:

    - Start Progress
    - Start Review
A Smart Commit with the action #start is ambiguous because it could mean either of the two transitions. To specify one of these two transitions, fully qualify the transition you want by using either #start-review or #start-progress.
